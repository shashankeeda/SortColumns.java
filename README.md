The runtime of this code is O(n^2) because a nested forloop is used to search through the strings multiple times and the space complexity of this code is O(n) 
because we are creating an array of size n in the code.

Sample input and output:

    How many strings will you enter
    3
    Enter a String
    aza
    Enter a String
    bvb
    Enter a String
    cac
    Original Array: aza bvb cac
    D=[1] or D=1
    Column 1: "z" "v" "a" is not sorted
    After Array: aa bb cc
